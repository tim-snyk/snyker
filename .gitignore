# Lock files from specific package managers (uv.lock seems to be from 'uv' package manager)
# If uv.lock IS intended to be shared (like poetry.lock or Pipfile.lock), then REMOVE this line.
# Typically, lock files for applications are committed, for libraries they might not be.
# Given 'uv' is a newer tool, confirm its best practices for uv.lock.
# For now, I'll assume it might be like a poetry.lock and should be committed,
# so I will comment it out. If you want to ignore it, uncomment the line below.
# uv.lock

# If you have other specific log files or temporary files, add them here.

# *.log
